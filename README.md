## React Native Todo List

This project was created during a live coding session in Socrates Santiago de Chile 2018.

clone the repo and cd to it, then:

yarn install  
yarn start

To actually see something you will need and device or an emulator configurated, you can start installing genymotion.

I have more info in configuring the environment in http://www.welinux.cl/wordpress/react-native-on-ubuntu/

*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
